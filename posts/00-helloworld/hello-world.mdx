## *Lessons learned while trying to break into the Tech industry*.

*** 
The decision to finally start writing a blog came after an embarassingly long time 
spent debating whether or not I had any authority to do so. While I'm still not 
entirely convinced that I do, I've come to realize how much *imposter syndrome* 
really seeps into every crevice of our lives when we decide to undergo a massive 
change. Now, I know what you're thinking, "Is this going to be just like the million 
articles on this very subject I've seen on Medium?" - and to be honest, it partly is. 
It is also my own personal experience, which I selfishly hope by outlining here can at 
the very least help me ease some of my own anxiety about putting yourself out there.
