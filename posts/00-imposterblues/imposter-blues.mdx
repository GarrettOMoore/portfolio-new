The decision to finally start writing a blog came after an embarassingly long time 
spent debating whether or not I had any authority to do so. While I'm still not 
entirely convinced that I do, I've come to realize the extent to which *imposter syndrome* 
really seeps into every crevice of our lives when we decide to undergo a massive 
change. Now, I know what you're thinking, "Is this going to be just like the million 
articles on this very subject I've seen on Medium?" - and to be honest, it partly is. 
It is also my own personal experience, which I selfishly hope by outlining here can at 
the very least help ease some of my own anxiety about putting yourself out there.

My background, similar to many I know - primarily consisted of working an assortment of 
jobs in order to support my passion for music and travelling. Which, don't get me wrong, 
was great - *for a while*. Writing code had been kind of a secret hobby of mine for a 
few years (alongside some youth experience making really bad GeoCities sites) - and I
finally decided to make the jump and **go hard** towards making that my new career. I 
spent a couple of years working on programming in between work, and playing shows - until 
I felt the push and decided to leave my job, and enroll in **General Assembly's** Software
Engineering Immersive program.
